## Introduction
In this project, you will work in teams of 4-5 to build a 3D computer game with 3 levels/stages that run in the browser (Chrome on Ubuntu) using the Three.js graphics framework. Your game should demonstrate mastery of various technical aspects of graphics, for example, hierarchical modelling, viewing and cameras, lighting and materials. Beyond these basic requirements, you are free to design any 3D game that you like. There are grades allocated to polish (have you put effort into the look and feel of your game beyond what HTML and Three.js give you by default) and innovation (have you implemented something that is not obvious – e.g. networking, multi-player, special effects, novel models, animated models etc.). Your final game should be playable from LAMP.

## Three.js
More information can be found at [Three.js Official Website](https://threejs.org/editor/). Check out their “Getting Started” and “Examples” pages for assistance. The textbook also discusses the library in Chapter 5. The library itself provides a scenegraph API. You can load and build models, attach physics engines, lights and cameras to your scene. The library traverses the graph to render the scene much in the same way that we have seen in the examples in class. You can place lights/cameras in the world, or attach them as children of objects which allows them to move together in the scene. You need to think carefully about the hierarchy of these objects in your world. Both the sensibility of your design as well as the motivation thereof will be assessed. The reason we choose Three.js is that the framework operates at a high enough level that you can create interesting and impressive games but at a low enough level (relative to Unity) that you still have to demonstrate a grasp of the design concepts considered in this course. Note that Three.js is a JavaScript library and all your code will be executed in a local browser. This means that you have to be cognisant of efficiency.

## Grading
You will be graded on the following aspects of your project. They will be assessed as is relevant to your game, but you should show a meaningful effort to illustrate each concept within your game.
- Viewing (10%)
- Control (10%)
- Playability (10%)
- 3D Effects (15%)
- Coding Style (10%)
- Design Style (25%)
- Polish (10%)
- Innovation (10%)
- Acknowledgments and References

## Group Members
You should work in groups of 4 or 5 which should be captured on Moodle. I will allocate a mentor to each group from the pool of CGV tutors. During each lab session, you should meet with your tutor for a few minutes to ask questions and get advice/ideas. It is your responsibility to approach your tutor with questions that you may have.

## Assessment
You will have 3 opportunities for feedback.
### Alpha
The alpha assessment is not for marks and is purely a formative assessment. You should have Three.js up and running. You need to have some preliminary implementation that you can use to illustrate to your mentor what the game will ultimately look like. Your mentor should walk through the rubric with you, and you need to be able to answer questions about how you have implemented/plan to implement the required functionality for each aspect of the rubric. The beta and final grading will mimic this setup.
### Beta
The beta version of your project will be graded and counts as the ‘beta project’ mark towards your class mark. This will be graded according to the rubric by a combination of tutors and moderdated by myself. You will need to demonstrate your project in action, talk us through the game, and be able to answer our questions about design choices, special effects etc. It is acceptable if your project has minor bugs at this stage, or if you still need to complete a level or two, but the project should fundamentally be finished and almost ready for production. This is your last chance to get formal feedback before your final hand-in/demonstration.
### Final Release
The final project submission will be graded according to the rubric by myself and the tutors. This will also be moderated by the external examiner. Everyone will be graded and should demonstrate their game, multiple times. You need to submit a maximum 2-page pdf describing/analysing/motivating/criticising your design decisions. This will count towards the practical exam mark of the course. You should have an online meeting with the primary tutor grading your project where you walk them through the game and answer questions for them. This meeting must be recorded. An alternate tutor and/or myself will watch the video, play the game and provide another grade as well. Your final mark will be a combination of these grades.

## Individual & Group Assessment
The project will be assessed as a group. However, similar to group work in Software Design, each group member will submit information (via Moodle), about what their and others’ responsibilities were, what they contributed to the project, and in what proportions they think the grades should be awarded in the group. Your individual mark may be adjusted by up to 20% based on my assessment of these results. If you do not contribute, your grade will be adjusted.

## Schedule
- You will have 1 week from the release of this handout to find/create a group.
- On Tuesday 12 September, you need to be able to explain to your tutor what the idea of your game will be and how you intend to meet the various grading criteria.
- On the week of Tuesday 3 October, you need to do your beta presentations.
- During the week of 24 October you need to do your final presentation to your project mentors for final grading.

## Resources
You are encouraged to use Google, YouTube, OpenCourseWare, StackOverflow and any other online resources. Links to online resources will be provided via Moodle when relevant, but you are encouraged to find your own as well.
